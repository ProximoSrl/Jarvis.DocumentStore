# Prerequisites

## Configuration Manager

You should install [Configuration Service](https://github.com/ProximoSrl/Jarvis.ConfigurationService) on your machine to run DocumentStore. You can download latest release and install with Powershell, or you can compile from source and do a manually install.

After configuration service is installed, you usually put a documentstore.redirect file that point to the Assets\config directory. A typical content of documentstore.redirect file is

	C:\develop\proximo\Jarvis\Assets\Configs

At the same level (root of configuration service) where you put this redirect file, you usually have another file called *parameters.documenstore.config* containing parameters for documentstore. You can find a sample of this file in the assets\configs folder in source. 

## External software

Various jobs of documenstore depends on external tools and libraries.
